We would like to dispute on the public results as shown on Botitu, using the command 'info leaderboard' and 'info result'. As shown in evaluation_results.jpeg, we have achieved a mAP score of 0.728822, which, to our understanding, is a relatively high score. However, in comparison to the other groups, our public score is ranked much lower than the rest. We have brought this issue up to the administrators of this hackathon and they have addressed this issue as a thread on 'algorithmn_support'. We hope that this discrepancy could be taken into consideration. Thank you.
